# Tic-Tac-Toe with AI

This project is asimple implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe with an AI opponent using the minimax algorithm in both C and C++. The AI has been designed to make moves, prioritizing choices that prevent the user player from winning. It plays the all future games with every possible moves until the end of the each game to make decision, making it nearly impossible for the user player to win.

This implementation works fine for small game boards, still poses performance issues for larger boards because of increased computating and memory consumption.
The project is good to keep for experimenting and exploring.

## Features

- Classic Tic-Tac-Toe gameplay.
- AI opponent using the minimax algorithm.
- Simple user interface using Qt.
